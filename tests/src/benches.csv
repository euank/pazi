# This is a CSV file (with # comment support too, sue me)
# This file describes what benchmarks to generate.
# The columns are:
# 1. The name of the benchmark function to run
# 2. A space-separated list of "Autojumper"s, 'j'
# 3. A space-separated list of shells, 's'
# 4. A bool indicating if it needs cgroups2 to run
# 
# The generated benchmarks will test all combinations j * s for that function.
#
# Note: z is left out of benches with zsh because it frequently fails and prints:
# > mv: cannot stat \'/tmp/pazi_bench.yyFRBViCftwU/home/pazi/.z.537\': No such file or directory
# It works fine in bash, and the cd bench works, but for some reason the jump
# one in zsh constantly hits that. I think it has to do with how $RANDOM works
# in zsh.
